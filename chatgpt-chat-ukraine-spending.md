# Taxpayer Costs Analysis: Ukraine, Iraq, Afghanistan, and WWII

## Q&A Summary

### Question 1: How much tax per day does the US tax-payer pay towards US funding of Ukraine's defense?
- **Answer**: Approximately **$1.17 per day per taxpayer** based on a total aid of $175 billion, spread over 1,000 days, divided by 150 million taxpayers.

### Question 2: How much of the aid to Ukraine from the US is in the form of "money" and how much in the form of military equipment? If possible, break down military equipment that is unused and possibly set to be scrapped.
- **Answer**:

    - Includes weapons, equipment, training, and logistical support.
    - Surplus military items (via the EDA program) are a significant portion.

### Question 3: Should the daily cost to US taxpayers be reduced, since they are not directly paying for EDA-sourced aid?
- **Answer**: While surplus equipment reduces direct costs, associated expenses (like refurbishment and shipping) still incur taxpayer funding. Adjusting for these efficiencies, **daily cost could be slightly lower** than $1.17/day.
